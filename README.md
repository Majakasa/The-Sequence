On the whole this project was a success and we were able to push into areas that weren't covered in class. Julio did an amazing job of incorporating 'node-sass' into the styling giving it a very modern polished look. Malcolm, did an outstanding job of combining API calls, and accomplished the very tricky task of allowing us to call an external API (Guidebox), capture that info, and then reroute it to get stored directly into our Mongo database as a given users collection of movies (while at the same time capturing their input regarding in this add function). Matt took the lead with some of the functionality and set it up so our calls worked all around with editing a user's collection or deleting it.

Some of our biggest challenges seemed to come in the form of mapping out the experience of the app (i.e. should it be more geared towards and individual user and their experience creating a playlist of movies, or towards someone coming to the site because they want to see other people's collections). However, this came up in the one-on-one meeting where it was discussed that we'd be digging deeper into the individual user side of development.
